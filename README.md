The plugin for Supybot/Limnoria does what it says, for most of the major sports/events. For whatever reason, this
"functionality" is either closed-source or missing in many IRC bots. With things like cfb, I attempt to be as
concise as possible. There are, obviously, better ways to display certain events within a sport, such as one game
per line. Unfortunately, this can get verbose, so I decided on a shorter-output, mixed with selective colors and
formatting, so it resembles more of a news ticker--better known as "the crawl"--instead of what you find on 
sports sites. If you would like to add a --long getopts in, please fork.
